It took between 3 and half hours to 4 to complete the exercise.

tests are located under src/test/java/Resttest

File contains the 4 requested exercises.


1-Retrieve the first 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on 1000 Martian sol. (tenFirstPhotosSunDate)
2-Retrieve the first 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on Earth date equal to 1000 Martian sol. (tenFirstPhotosEarthDate)
3-Retrieve and compare the first 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on 1000 sol and on Earth date equal to 1000 Martian sol. (compareImages)
4-Validate that the amounts of pictures that each "Curiosity" camera took on 1000 Mars sol is not greater than 10 times the amount taken by other cameras on the same date. (validateAmountOfPictures)


It was not completely clear to me what was expected for test #4, at the end I got the number of images 
for each camera inside curiosity and compare that against the sum of all the photos taken by the other
rovers on the same day multiplied by 10.
